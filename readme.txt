Cylinder Volume Calculator Program:

This C++ program was written as part of my learning journey to understand the basics of C++ programming. The program calculates the volume of a cylinder based on user input.

Program Overview:

- Prompts the user to input the radius and height of the cylinder
- Calculates the volume of the cylinder using the formula V = πr²h
- Displays the result

Features:

- User input for radius and height
- Use of const variable for pi value
- Use of multiplication operator for volume calculation
- Clear and informative output

How to Run the Program:

1. Copy the provided C++ code into a .cpp file
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler
3. Run the compiled program:
    - On Linux/macOS: ./cylinder_volume_calculator
    - On Windows: cylinder_volume_calculator.exe
4. Enter the radius and height when prompted

Learning Objectives:

- Understanding basic user input and output
- Using floating-point variables and arithmetic operators
- Working with mathematical formulas and constants
- Basic program structure and syntax
